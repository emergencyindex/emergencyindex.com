    <strong>Emergency INDEX</strong> is an annual print publication documenting performances that occurred in one calendar year. Begun in 2011, <em>INDEX</em> was conceived as a "state of the field" publication that could present a year-to-year view of the issues, techniques, and challenges that performance makers dealt with in the work they actualized. Every year since then, <em>INDEX</em> has published hundreds of documents of performances made in various genres and media, for different audiences and purposes, and in a wide variety of venues, cities, and countries. Each annual volume includes three back-of-the-book indexes: an index of terms, an index of places, and an index of contributors. Taking as its starting point actual performances described by the artists who made them, <strong>Emergency INDEX</strong> proposes building your performance theory from the ground up.
