_Emergency INDEX_ is an annual print publication documenting new performance in the words of its creators. For more information, see our [Project Description](/about/project-description/) page.

Submissions for Volume 10/+ are now open, and you are invited to submit a description of a performance you made in 2021. **The deadline to submit is October 10th, 2022**. For more information on submitting your performance, check out our [FAQ](/submission-FAQ/) and follow guidelines in the [submission form](http://emergency-index-submission-ten-plus.glitch.me).

Unlike previous years, Volume 10/+ will be a special "pandemic" issue that includes performances made in 2020 and those made in 2021. Because of the increased number of contributions, and the physical limitation of a paper book, some contributions will appear in the print volume (Vol. 10), and some will appear in an online-only volume (Vol. 10+). The submission period for 2020 performances was held last year, and is now closed. This open call is for performances made in 2021.

After a decade of documenting performance in the wild, Vol. 10/+ will be the final volume of Emergency Index published by Ugly Duckling Presse. That said, there are exciting discussions underway about continuing the Index project as a Spanish-language publication, under the leadership of our collaborators across Latin America. If you are interested in getting involved as an editor, designer or indexer with the production of the Spanish-language Emergency Index, please contact [espanolemergency@gmail.com](mailto:espanolemergency@gmail.com)

See below for example pages from Volume 6, which includes 279 works from 46 countries performed during 2016. Please email [indexintern@gmail.com](mailto:indexintern@gmail.com) with any questions.
