### FAQ

##### Q: How can I find my performance, I don't see it anywhere!

##### A: The digital editors of _**Emergency INDEX**_ are dedicated to making sure that everyone is represented on this digital archive as enthusiastically as possible. Use the [search](/archive/search-archives/) page to find yourself by beginning to type your name or the title of your project.

##### Q: What's with this search page anyway, it doesn't look like Google, why isn't it Google? What is this?

##### A: The search page uses auto-complete as you type to generate search results according to the word/words you are typing. At the moment it is searching through the contributor name, location, and title of every project in [Volumes](/archive/volumes/) 1-6 (2011-2016). We are working on expanding the search functionality of the site, feel free to help us by donating to our non-profit publisher Ugly Duckling Presse.

##### Q: I'm the contributor of a performance and there are errors on the page - what do I do?
