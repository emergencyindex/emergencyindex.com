### Project template

All of the project files need to include this [YAML](http://yaml.org/) metadata at the top of the Markdown file:

```markdown
---
layout: project
volume: 
image: 
photo_credit: 
title: 
first_performed: 
place: 
times_performed: 
contributor: 
collaborators:
  -
home: 
links: 
  - 
contact: 
footnote: 
tags: 
  - 
pages:
needs_review:
---

text here will be the project's description. limited html markup is supported tho probably discouraged. other markdown is preferred.
```

see [MARKDOWN_NOTES.md](MARKDOWN_NOTES.md) for help getting started with markdown.
