Two characters face-to-face, in dialogue, with their respective techniques and paths: one using “popping,” a technique from hip-hop dance, the other playing percussion. This unadorned encounter, intense and turbulent, tends to make of the stage the gushing of a speech full of images, where the energy and charge invested in each movement are more important than the visible phenomenon, and where masks, real and imaginary, unfurl and break impalpable, that are the landscapes of our souls. The subject is rough, dreamlike and hypnotic, always seeking to push the artists beyond their limits. The ornaments are those brought by life itself, eminently present in this semi-improvised meeting.
