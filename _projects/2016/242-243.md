“Charm for Bleeding Women” is inspired by my familial roots in Braucherei, a folk magic system practiced in Pennsylvania German culture. The performance referenced the structure of the folk charm to generate a protective spell for the female body and cycles of bleeding that are present from first menstruation through menopause.

The work was performed at a white clothed table and was bookended by a cleansing ritual, in which I took milk from a bowl into my mouth and spat it out into a second bowl. I pressed a circle of cherries with my palm, measured my body with a red ribbon which had been dipped into red fluid, and cut a slit into the bodice of my dress. The gestures of staining and cutting were repeated three times, and then followed by an act of mending, as I stitched the wounds on the front of my dress.
