“SOFT DATA” was an interactive performance art piece in which my body acted as an informal polling station to collect data. By slipping sheets of paper in the numerous pockets in my custom jumpsuit, participants contributed to soft data collecting while reinforcing the inherent connections between our ideological, physical, and emotional selves. I created “SOFT DATA” to express my experiences as a woman during the 2016 presidential election cycle, a time in which my body and mind felt constantly attacked.

“SOFT DATA” began with me reading a statement through a megaphone: “I make daily choices to live out my ideals.” Audience members approached me and slipped small pieces of paper into one of a plethora of pockets on my jumpsuit. The multitude of tiny pockets were inspired by both a ballot box and graph paper, means of collecting and recording data. The pockets spanned across the torso of my body; they indicated positive feelings on the right and negative feelings on the left. After tallying and publicly displaying the results, I returned to the megaphone: “My physical strength aligns with my mental strength.” Again, audience members approached, and merged ideals and emotions as they cast their vote on my body. Additional statements and questions included: “I am part of something larger than myself.” / “I see myself in the people elected to represent me.” / “How would you predict the 100 year forecast, centered here in Brooklyn and radiating outward?”
