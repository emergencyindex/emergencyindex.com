“The Right Kind of Red” explored conventional notions of femininity and their origins. The performance sought to subvert these ideals, pairing the familiar with the uncomfortable. The performance referenced traditional female crafts, media portrayals of women’s mouths, and the concept of purity.

A video was projected onto a wall. The audience saw a woman’s lips; red fabric is stuffed into her mouth and pulled out again creating a bloody waterfall. The woman did the same with red wool, the string tied to her tongue, the materials crammed impatiently into her mouth and yanked out in a series of edited clips. The audience never saw her eyes.

Two women in white, floor-length dresses entered the space, interrupting the projection with their bodies. They performed a sequence of movements, slowly moving from one position to another. One woman sat in a chair, watching the other shift in space, while she unravelled a large ball of wool and wrapped the string tightly around her ring finger.
