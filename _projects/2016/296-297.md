“City Doctors (not actual doctors)” was an interactive, satirical project that positioned a collective of local artists as expert advisors on how to live in cities. Welcoming all queries from visiting participants, the members of EQU▲L▲TER▲L were on site to prescribe idiosyncratic and highly subjective advice on how best to navigate the physical, social, and everyday complexities of our shared urban landscape.

Following a one-on-one consultation with a city doctor, participants walked away with a personalized set of instructions for how to troubleshoot their urban quandaries and maximize the experience of living in the city. “City Doctors” was developed to be featured in public street and laneway festivals, and explored ways to animate urban spaces and transform the public realm.
