This performance is part of a body of work exploring the impact that costuming has on our state of consciousness and perception, as well as our intuition, persona, and transcendence. This particular image is from an isolated performance in the Sand Dunes of Death Valley National Park. The costume work is entitled “Nebula,” and references the great expanse of space and possibility, micro and macro, public and private. The wearing of this garment on the sand dunes represented the human connection with the earth and universe, and represented the wearers coming to terms with the body trapped between the two realms. The action performed was meant to physically induce an altered state between the physical and metaphysical by hindering the senses (breath, sight, smell, hearing), while outwardly representing the expanse of space felt within through sensory deprivation. Movements, meditation, and video imagery were performed during this time.
