Two cisgender male bodies kiss their own images which are reflected in a single double-sided mirror. This lasts for one hour without interruption, while they move their connected bodies to different areas.

Despite the mirror acting as an obstacle preventing the two mouths engaging, to the audience, they appear to be in contact.

With this piece, I explore LGBT politics to generate critical thinking around power relationships, usually protected by normative regimes, and how these structures control and discipline.
