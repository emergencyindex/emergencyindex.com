In “Homosexuality,” the performer undresses in an art gallery in downtown Madrid in order to draw 78 crosses on his body. Later on he cuts himself six times on his chest.

This performance is a peaceful reflection of the fact that there are numerous violent, state-sanctioned acts against sexual diversity in society. Homosexuality is forbidden in 78 countries, and in six countries being gay results in the death penalty.
