“Pace Investigations No.4” was a fifteen-day site-specific performance and residual installation. Each day, the same performance was repeated and either lost or recovered time. The actions of the performance were site-sensitive, responding and adapting to the varying conditions already present in the space. The actions responded to various factors including: pedestrian traffic observed from a nearby window, the site’s architecture, other artworks throughout the exhibition, and sonic and olfactory stimuli in close proximity.

The time structure was rigid, but the content of the performance itself remained spontaneous. As the performance repeated, the actions had to adapt to the temporal constraint and the needs of a tiring body. How the actions adapted was decided in the moment. Some actions became unrecognizable from previous performance cycles. Some sped up. Others slowed down. Some were abandoned. Some merged, to become different actions all together. Regardless of how the performance changed, the tension between mechanical, affective, and shared time was always palpable.

What began as a two-hour performance incrementally became a one-minute performance and then moved back up to become a two-hour performance again.

“Pace Investigations No.4” asked how one copes with acceleration and deceleration while enduring institutional mediation, shared space, and other external forces.
