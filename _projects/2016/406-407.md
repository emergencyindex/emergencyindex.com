“Temping,” the strange and comic tale of an employee’s inner life, was performed for an audience of one by a Windows PC, a corporate phone, a laser printer, and the Microsoft Office Suite.

Filling in at Sarah Jane’s cubicle, as the audience, you update client records, send emails, and eavesdrop on intra-office romance. Each performance is unique, depending on which tasks you accomplish and which of your co-workers you decide to trust. Audience were required to do office work for the span of the forty-five minute actor-less performance.

The performance was created by a team of technologists, creating a fully built office cubicle acting as a storytelling space. Contrasting the anonymity of an Excel spreadsheet with furtive moments of human intimacy, “Temping” brought audiences deep into the heart of corporate America.
