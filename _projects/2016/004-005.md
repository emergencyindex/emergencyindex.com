“WHO BORE IT WETTER?” is about time, ownership, culture, and beauty. It is about aesthetic judgments and genealogical research. It is about access. It is about problematizing its content, which walks gloved hand in gloved hand with its form. It runs on the concrete, aiming to literally slip on its host and dive in. Expiring. Fantasy. Our bodies. Controllers.

“WHO  BORE IT WETTER?” is a book/performance that interrogates the process of print-on-demand book publishing. It began on September 16 PST with the simultaneous uploading of the same file to two competing book-printing platforms—Lulu and Blurb. It continued to run through September 30. No orders to print the book were made and therefore it was deleted from Blurb’s servers; Lulu, however, continues to bear it.
