For this improvised performance, I wanted to tell the audience the opposite of what they wanted to hear.

The performance happened on a rooftop. I was dressed casually and held only a microphone.

The theme was gender, sexuality, and my ignorance and prejudice against progressive thinking. My aim was to expose my fears and discomfort, sharing them with the audience. I also wanted to show that certain groups might be living in a bubble, that uneasiness is present, that many people are too afraid to fully express themselves, and that condemning phobias might not always be the best approach.

Many audience members were angry at me and remained silent. Others expressed admiration for my honesty days and weeks later. After the performance, I felt that I had more to learn about gender, sexuality, and different lifestyles.
