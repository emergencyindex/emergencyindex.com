I am interested in the process by which the complex American libido has given way to our culture’s mediatization. Furthermore, exploring how this reflects back onto our social and political dimension by controlling the mechanisms of our potential freedom and schizophrenic identity. I try to extend these drives and desire even further through poetry or humor to create a rupture in this system.

In this performance, I embark on road trips and use various American motifs as stages to highlight our specific cultural fiction. I am converting a dented Pontiac Grand Am into a Lamborghini with an air of desperation, complete with vertical doors, lights, and sound system. This will act as my vehicle in which I will explore facets of the American libido including food challenges, sports cars, natural wonders, celebrity/youth culture, and road trips as platforms for revelation. My costumes will include political, celebrity, and philosophical references. I perform as a displaced wanderlust protagonist, wandering through a fictional, broken cultural narrative.

This project is ongoing and will be shown at Artpace this summer.
