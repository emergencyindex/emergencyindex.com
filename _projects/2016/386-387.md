“lil BLK” is an experimental solo performance. Influenced by New York City gay/queer ballroom culture, live punk shows, butoh and praise dance, “lil BLK” is a story about a fairy boi, child of god, little black girl, performer, and activist. The story plays out through a series of biographical moments that are equal parts narrative and dream. Wrestling with the desire to be seen in a society hell bent on controlling and crushing the black feminine body and spirit, the performance aims to subvert these constraints and offers an unfettered representation of this experience. Through the exploration of theatrical form, Nic Kay highlights these desires among the traps of being a black performer searching for freedom on the stage and in a beat.
