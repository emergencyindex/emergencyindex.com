In “Broached Topics” the artist donned 100 pieces of jewelry while making statements about the current political climate concerning social, psychological, and physiological aspects of being a woman. In each of ten sets of statements, the artist first made a crass assertion that most people would find offensive. She put on a handful of pieces of jewelry. Each successive statement was made in a less derogatory manner. As the language becomes more socially acceptable, fewer pieces of jewelry were donned. The final statement in each set, while more socially acceptable, was still the same sentiment as the first, offensive assertion. Over the course of the performance, the jewelry built to a claustrophobic amount as the artist struggled to hook necklaces, bracelets, and earrings onto her overburdened body. The performance explored how language can be manipulated to allow for general acceptance of otherwise questionable assertions.
