We’ve blended together butoh (Theresa Magario) and live drawing (Hugo Crosthwaite) with a soundscape (Marilu Salinas) that brings the audience into an experience of moving in terms of migrating, immigrating, and emigrating. “Heroic Procession” begins from the moment the choice is made to leave home right through to the journey’s inconclusive ending. Between recent global disasters, natural and man made, millions have decided to take their own journeys away from ruin to find, create, and improve upon their lives. Should changeable laws, senseless barriers, and imaginary borderlines prevent humans the dignity of moving forward to the betterment of themselves? We open a space for this discourse.
