### General FAQ

<dl class ="faq">
  <dt>Q: How can I help with this awesome project?</dt>
  <dd>A: We donate our time, love, and labor to this project because we value the performance work we encounter through your submissions. If you want to help out, you can donate money, donate time, or help by curating/hosting an <em>INDEX</em>-themed event. At the very least, let people in your network and community know about the book. Ask your library to order it, and encourage performance-oriented organizations to carry it.</dd>

  <dt>Q: Do you have any language I can use when I tell people about <em>Emergency INDEX</em>?</dt>
  <dd>A: Sure!<br>
  "<em>Emergency INDEX</em> is a yearly, paper-based, durable document of the 'state of the field' of performance, based on 100s of actual performances made in one calendar year, all over the world. Published by Ugly Duckling Presse, <em>INDEX</em> has been surveying a broad spectrum of performance practice since 2011, and now features a new website with fully searchable archives."</dd>

  <dt>Q: How can I get a free copy of <em>Emergency INDEX</em>?</dt>
  <dd>A: See the FAQ for “How can I help with this awesome project?” Volunteers always receive a complimentary copy of the book.</dd>

  <dt>Q: What’s with this search page anyway, it doesn’t look like Google, why isn’t it Google? What is this?</dt>
  <dd>A: The <a href="/archive/search-archives/">search page</a> uses auto-complete as you type to generate search results according to the word/words you are typing.

We are working on expanding the search functionality of the site, feel free to help us by <a href="https://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/support/" target="_blank">donating to our non-profit publisher Ugly Duckling Presse</a> and tagging your tax-deductible donation for “INDEX WEBSITE.”</dd>
